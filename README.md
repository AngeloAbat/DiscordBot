Personal Project made by Me

__🛠️This project is currently Work in Progress 🛠️__


**DESCRIPTION**
"This bot is used to learn how to code with Discord.js as well as providing a few fun command/mechanics such as Bullying someone, Rolling a Dice, Flirting, Puns, and more. Me and my friends are currently using this bot to goof around with my friends using commands.git add"

"The original idea of this bot is to be able to join a discord call and play a music from either Youtube or Spotify(🛠️ Work in Progress 🛠️) as well as stop and skip track, it should be able to also create and follow a playlist."




**Mentions**
- Erika Valdez helped me fill the datapools, as well as provide command ideas.

__**This bot has no intentions of being used to get any source of income**__
