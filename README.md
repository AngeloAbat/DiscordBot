Personal Project made by Me


__🛠️This project is currently Work in Progress 🛠️__



**DESCRIPTION**

<This bot is used to learn how to code with Discord.js as well as providing a few fun command/mechanics such as Bullying someone, Rolling a Dice, Flirting, Puns, and more. Me and my friends are currently using this bot to goof around with my friends using commands.git add

The original idea of this bot is to be able to join a discord call and play a music from either Youtube or Spotify(🛠️ Work in Progress 🛠️) as well as stop and skip track, it should be able to also create and follow a playlist.>
